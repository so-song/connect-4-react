# Correct 4 - React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objective

    Description

This game is played on a vertical board wich has seven hollow columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced. There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides.

In short, itÂ´s a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.

Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different colour. The board is empty at the start of the game.

    Objective

The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
